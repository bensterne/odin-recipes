    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I fell in love with gnocchi as a boy in the Italian restaurant in my small town in
        New York. This ricotta gnocchi recipe was passed down to me by my great-aunt. 
       It is easy, traditional, and delicious!.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves, finely shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the gnocchi: Stir together ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces and roll into 1/2-inch thick ropes on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Boil the gnocchi until they float to the surface, 1 to 2 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>Stir cubed mozzarella into the sauce and allow the heat of the sauce to soften but not melt the cheese.</li>
    </ol>
